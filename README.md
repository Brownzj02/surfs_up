# PyCitySchools Analysis
Utilizing my own API calls to create tables adding some of that information build a flask site.

## Overview
Purpose of this analysis is to create data analysis to present to an investor interested in my surf and shake shop. His main concern is weather, as in a previous venture it was not sustainable because a weather analysis was not performed. Untilizing SQLite, API, and flask I was able to create a webpage through VSCode and create tables locally without having to utilize a SQL server that may not otherwise be available. I compiled the data, which is then visualized and can be accessed by other users. 
## Results
In the analysis I created Queries for the months of June and December. For both months I pulled tempurature data for each day, then calculated the stastics behind those numbers to simplify the information provided into tables. Oahu seems to have consistently warm to moderate tempartures for both months and through additonal anaylsis it could probably be determined how the weather is the other 10 months of the year. Both June and December had their highest temps between 80-85 the lowest temps which vary at 56 in December and 64 in June. Additional search queries should include finding percipitation numbers for both months and again thoughout the year.
